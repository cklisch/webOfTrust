Functionality

1. The user shall be able to either create a random "web of trust" with a number
   of nodes and density of his own choice or load an existing "web of trust"
   from a text file into the program.

2. The user then shall be able to calculate the trust between two nodes by
   stating how long the maximum path length shall be.

3. The calculated trust shall be consistent and representative of real world 
   dynamics.
 
Design

i.   The main function communicates with the user. One C file will be dealing
     with web management and another with the get_trust function.

ii.  1. get_web will put data from a .txt file into an array of nodes which make 
        up the web of trust and returns the pointer to the first node.

     2. mk_randweb will create a random web with x nodes and y average links
        at each node. Each node may only link once to another.  

     3. get_trust will calculate the trust from one node to another.

iii. The main object is the web which has the number of nodes and the pointer
     to the first node as attributes. The node itself is an object which
     states the number of links it has to other nodes and then those links.
     The get_trust function needs an accumilator for each node to store the
     composition of trust to that specific node.
 
iv.  Our common coding style shall closely adhere to the "linux kernel coding
     style".
